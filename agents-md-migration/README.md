# AGENTS.md Migration

[한국어](README_ko.md)

Does moving a project context file from `CLAUDE.md` to **AGENTS.md** make Claude Code slower or more expensive?

That question is where this study started.

[AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) is the open context-file format governed by AAIF (Agentic AI Foundation, Linux Foundation), read by 30+ coding agents. Claude Code does not read it natively ([issue #34235](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/34235)), so a migration needs one of two workarounds: an `@AGENTS.md` import line inside `CLAUDE.md`, or a `CLAUDE.md` symlink pointing at `AGENTS.md`. This study measures whether either workaround costs anything, on real Kubernetes incident-response tasks.

> Scenarios, scoring parser, and audit capture are reused from the companion [AIOps Agent Benchmark](https://github.com/sysnet4admin/Research/tree/main/AIOps-Agent-Benchmark). This study runs Claude Code only; it is not a cross-vendor comparison.

## TL;DR

- **All three delivery methods load.** A canary check confirmed Claude Code follows both the `@AGENTS.md` import and the symlink (a no-context control did not respond to the canary).
- **No systematic slowdown.** Across 5 model configurations (Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.6, Sonnet 5, Opus 4.8, Fable 5), wall-time deltas flip sign between conditions and do not track token deltas, which is the signature of LLM run-to-run variance, not context-loading overhead.
- **No token-cost penalty.** Cache-write token deltas between conditions stay within ±6% and move together with the symlink condition, which is mechanically identical to native and therefore acts as a built-in control. On four models the import measured 3 to 4% lower than native; on Sonnet 5 both the import and the symlink measured 6% higher, which marks that delta as run-to-run noise rather than a delivery cost.
- **Reproduced on a native AGENTS.md reader.** On OpenCode with two local models (gemma4:12b, qwen3.8:27b, 80 runs), the fallback path (CLAUDE.md) and the native path (AGENTS.md) showed no speed or task-outcome difference either. See the [extension section](#extension-a-native-agentsmd-reader-opencode).

## Conditions

The payload (context body) is byte-identical across conditions, verified by checksum. Only the delivery mechanism differs.

| Condition | Files in the agent working directory | How Claude Code loads it |
|---|---|---|
| **A** native | `CLAUDE.md` (body) | reads `CLAUDE.md` directly |
| **B** import | `CLAUDE.md` (single line `@AGENTS.md`) + `AGENTS.md` (body) | follows the `@AGENTS.md` import |
| **C** symlink | `AGENTS.md` (body) + `CLAUDE.md` symlink to it | opening the `CLAUDE.md` path makes the OS resolve the link and return the `AGENTS.md` content |

In condition C, Claude Code does nothing special: the filesystem resolves the link at open time, so from Claude Code's side the read is identical to native. That also makes C a built-in control group: any delta C shows against A is measurement noise, so B only carries a real indirection cost if it exceeds what C shows.

The payload is a real, human-curated context file (the AIOps benchmark's project `CLAUDE.md`: cluster rules, scoring formulas, known pitfalls), not a synthetic document.

## Results

### Cost: cache-write tokens

If the import or symlink inflated what gets loaded, condition B would show more cache-write tokens than the control C. Median per condition (n = 12 per cell: 4 scenarios x 3 repetitions):

| Model | A (native) | B (import) vs A | C (symlink, control) vs A |
|---|---|---|---|
| Haiku 4.5 | 22,049 | -3% | +1% |
| Sonnet 4.6 | 14,357 | -3% | -1% |
| Sonnet 5 | 17,252 | +6% | +6% |
| Opus 4.8 | 15,542 | -4% | -1% |
| Fable 5 | 16,357 | -3% | -1% |

No row shows B systematically above the control. On four models the import measured 3 to 4% lower than native; on Sonnet 5 it measured 6% higher, but the symlink control moved by the same +6% in the same runs, and a symlink cannot mechanically differ from native. So the Sonnet 5 delta is run-to-run noise (its output tokens also rose about 20% in those conditions), not an indirection cost.

Two caveats about this metric surfaced in the data. Cache-write totals accumulate across turns, so longer solution paths write more cache. And adjacent runs with an identical assembled context can hit the server-side prompt cache within its TTL, sharply reducing the write (observed once). The per-run cluster snapshot guarantees a cold start at the cluster level, not at the API cache level.

### Speed: wall time

Median wall time per condition (seconds):

| Model | A | B | C |
|---|---|---|---|
| Haiku 4.5 | 22.1 | 22.8 | 29.8 |
| Sonnet 4.6 | 40.1 | 51.9 | 37.6 |
| Sonnet 5 | 49.7 | 53.7 | 47.8 |
| Opus 4.8 | 76.2 | 69.1 | 89.3 |
| Fable 5 | 79.2 | 90.6 | 76.5 |

Deltas are large but unsystematic: the sign flips between models and conditions, and the biggest time deltas come with near-zero token deltas (for example Haiku C: +35% time, +3% tokens). A delivery-method overhead would produce a consistent sign; this pattern is agent trajectory variance.

Output tokens and tool-call counts are also flat (within ±15% and ±8%, mixed signs).

## Extension: a native AGENTS.md reader (OpenCode)

The main study measures Claude Code, which has no native AGENTS.md support.
The obvious follow-up question is whether the same holds on an agent that
reads AGENTS.md natively and treats CLAUDE.md as a fallback. OpenCode does
exactly that, so the delivery method can be varied at the agent's own file
resolution layer instead of through an import line.

Two conditions, each with the payload byte-identical: **CO** puts only
CLAUDE.md in the working directory (the fallback path), **AO** puts only
AGENTS.md (the native path). Two local models through Ollama (gemma4:12b,
qwen3.8:27b), the same four low-variance scenarios, 5 repetitions,
conditions alternating within each repetition: 80 runs, all rc=0.

**No difference, again.** Pairing each repetition's CO and AO run directly
(20 pairs per model), AO was slower in 7 of 20 pairs on one model and 12 of
20 on the other; the mean pair difference is a few percent of its own
standard deviation, and run-to-run spread within one condition dwarfs it.
Task outcomes agree: 13 versus 15 solved runs (CO/AO, gemma4:12b) and 15
versus 18 (qwen3.8:27b), a gap inside run-to-run variance at this sample
size.

Two behaviors of the resolution order came out of the load check, verified
on both models: the CLAUDE.md fallback does load when AGENTS.md is absent,
and when both files are present AGENTS.md wins.

One methodological trap is worth passing on. A load canary that only asks
"what is the codeword" is not enough, because a model can find the file with
a grep tool and answer correctly without the file ever entering its context.
The probe has to require the right codeword **with zero tool calls**; an
earlier pass that omitted this check produced an invalid campaign and was
re-run.

Per-scenario tables, the scoring rule, the invalidation record, and the
runner scripts are in
[studies/opencode-native](studies/opencode-native/RESULTS.md).

## Method

- **Tasks**: Kubernetes incident-response scenarios from the AIOps Agent Benchmark (broken deployment, wrong service selector, OOM limit, failing readiness probe). Each run: restore cluster snapshot, inject the fault, run the agent with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, cold start.
- **Isolation**: the agent runs in a fresh temp working directory containing only the condition's context files, on a dedicated 2-node cluster (not shared with other benchmarks). Every kubectl command pins `--context agents-md-migration`.
- **Fairness**: condition order is shuffled per scenario so time-of-day drift cannot pile onto one condition. The user-level `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` is identical for all conditions, so it cancels out.
- **Load verification first**: before measuring speed, a canary line in the payload ("reply PONG-AGENTSMD to PING") confirmed each condition actually loads. All three responded; the empty-directory control did not.
- **Volume**: a 10-scenario pass across A/B/C (30 runs, Sonnet 5), then a model sweep on the 4 low-variance scenarios x A/B/C x 5 models x 3 repetitions (180 runs). All 210 published runs completed rc=0; one run hit a transient API 500 server error and was re-run under the infrastructure-failure policy.

## Environment

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Claude Code | 2.1.198 (4-model sweep), 2.1.199 (Sonnet 5 runs), load check on 2.1.195 |
| Models | claude-haiku-4-5, claude-sonnet-4-6, claude-sonnet-5, claude-opus-4-8, claude-fable-5 |
| Kubernetes | v1.36.2 (kubeadm), containerd 2.2.3, Ubuntu 24.04 |
| Cluster | 1 control-plane + 1 worker, Vagrant + VirtualBox, Calico CNI, MetalLB |
| Measured | 2026-07-02 to 2026-07-04 |

| Node | Role | IP |
|---|---|---|
| cp-k8s | control-plane | 192.168.2.10 |
| w1-k8s | worker | 192.168.2.11 |

## Reproduce

```bash
# 1) cluster
cd test-cluster && ./up.sh && ./snapshot.sh    # baseline snapshot

# 2) one run: condition x scenario x repetition tag
cd ../studies/agents-md-import-speed
./run_one.sh B 001-crashloop r1

# 3) full pass and model sweep
./run_suite.sh r1
REPS=3 bash run_model_sweep.sh

# 4) aggregate
python3 report_sweep.py   # model x condition medians
python3 aggregate.py      # per-run CSV
```

Per-run raw data (`runs/`) and the measured payload (a working project `CLAUDE.md` that contains private operational notes) stay in the private workspace; this repository publishes the harness scripts and the aggregated results. Any byte-identical payload placed in the three `variants/` layouts reproduces the comparison, since only the delivery mechanism differs. The aggregation scripts (`aggregate.py`, `report_sweep.py`) import the AIOps benchmark's parser, which is not published; treat them as method documentation.

## Limitations

- Accuracy and safety scoring (Ops_Score, deterministic audit-based unsafe-action count) were not part of this pass; the study answers the speed and token-cost question. The audit slices are captured per run, so that scoring can be added later.
- The model sweep covers the 4 low-variance scenarios; the harder scenarios (multi-step root-cause chains) ran once per condition and are dominated by trajectory variance, which is exactly why the sweep was scoped to the low-variance set.
- In the OpenCode extension, task outcomes were scored heuristically (did a correct fix land, did a health check follow) rather than with the deterministic audit-based scorer, and the two models are local ones; the finding is "no difference detected at this sample size", not a proof of equivalence.

## Prior work

- [arXiv 2601.20404](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20404) measured human-written AGENTS.md files with Codex (native AGENTS.md reader): median runtime -28.6%, output tokens -16.6%. It did not measure the import indirection or a non-native reader, which is the gap this study fills for Claude Code.
- An [ETH Zurich study (arXiv 2602.11988)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11988) found LLM-generated AGENTS.md files *reduced* success and raised cost, so how the file is written decides the outcome. This study holds the file fixed (human-curated) and varies only the delivery method.
